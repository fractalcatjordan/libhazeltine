Evan's Handy Guide to Construct Flaring
by Evan

Hello friends, your fellow psion Evan here. In this article you'll get an explanation of how to flare a construct (obviously). But some of you less informed folks might be asking, "Evan, what would flaring be?" The answer is simple, it's giving light, or color, to an otherwise dull construct that you wouldn't be able to see otherwise.

Now, do I have your attention? Good. The reason I'm writing this is so you guys will stop asking me, and everyone else on Earth how to do it, because, with all due respect, it's annoying. Now we can just say, "Look at the articles," like we always do.

First off, you'll have to know how to make a psi construct, which comes pretty easily after practice. Now before you guys expect me to explain how to make a construct, let me make it clear that I'm NOT going to explain how to make constructs. It's your job to read the articles. I personally suggest reading them ALL, since they all contain different bits and pieces to the delicate "OMG ITS SO HARD" psi construct creating process. And so you don't have to waste your precious time finding the articles, here are some:

A few other things are needed to, like visualization skills and programming skills. Those topics have a few good articles on them too. Now with all of that mumbo jumbo out of the way, let's start this up...

You should start this off by making a psi construct. Anything at all, as long as it's made from psi, which I don't really see what else you could make it with... After that, visualize the construct, whatever it may be, and try to overlap the picture in your brain with the real thing. Make them feel the same, look the same, etc... Try to hold the overlapping for as long as you can. You'll need it. Once you can accomplish this, you're ready for the next step. And be warned, the 'overlapping' may take a bit of concept grasping to understand, but after thinking about it a little, it should come to you.

After you have them successfully overlapped, start spinning them very fast. Any way is fine, as long as it's fast. Try imagining a whirring sound, if it helps. Have you ever seen something go so fast it makes a whirring sound? That's what we're going for. Try to imagine little wisps of wind moving around the construct, so you can recognize that it's moving very fast. And note that the spinning isn't necessary, it just helps with the final step...

After you have both spinning fast, suddenly visualize the original visualization, not the actual construct, erupting into light. Make sure the eruption is very forceful. After you do this, the real thing should at least spark a little, considering you had the visualization and the actual construct overlapped in your mind.

If this doesn't work, I'll leave you with this: Keep trying. Bwahahaha. Am I evil!? Oh yes I am. Anyway, on a more serious note, this WILL probably take a few tries to get, but it works for me. Have fun, and I'll see you guys in another article one day...
