Advanced Constructs Seminar
by Peebrain

Edited by Peebrain to improve readability.

[19:04] peebrain: the topic tonight is:... Advanced Constructs
[19:04] peebrain: everyone in here SHOULD know what a construct is
[19:04] peebrain: but I have a gut feeling that there are some people in here that have no clue
[19:05] peebrain: so, let's do a quick review
[19:05] peebrain: 1. We manipulate psi
[19:05] peebrain: 2. We take that psi and glob it together
[19:05] peebrain: 3. We tell the psi what to do
[19:05] peebrain: and that glob of psi is called a "construct"
[19:05] peebrain: the most common construct being.......
[19:05] peebrain: tada... the infamous psi ball
[19:06] peebrain: you move the psi into a ball, and program it to "sit there in the shape of a ball"
[19:06] peebrain: programming is usually accomplished with visualization
[19:08] peebrain: when you get better, usually you don't have to visualize every last thing, but you just get a feel for it
[19:08] peebrain: so, for example, when I program my constructs, I kind of just imprint the programming onto it, without really visualizing
[19:09] peebrain: I bet some people in here know what I'm talking about
[19:09] peebrain: if you're like "huh?", don't worry, just keep practicing, it comes with time
[19:09] peebrain: so, that's a quick overview of a construct
[19:09] peebrain: take the psi, jam it together, and program it
[19:10] peebrain: but now it turns into: so what?
[19:10] peebrain: how are these constructs useful at all?
[19:10] peebrain: if your only skill is to glob psi together, then it's probably not that useful
[19:10] peebrain: it's fun, but... that wears off after a while
[19:10] peebrain: the more psychic skills you learn, the more you can do with constructs
[19:11] peebrain: for example, if you learn to spin a pinwheel with telekinesis, then you can program a construct to spin a pinwheel with telekinesis
[19:11] peebrain: if you're really good at TK, you can make more solid constructs, called "force bubbles"
[19:11] peebrain: if you can do telepathy, you can program constructs to do things related to telepathy
[19:14] peebrain: the construct is limited to your ability, because it won't understand what to do otherwise
[19:14] peebrain: some people think that they don't have to learn TK, they just need to learn force bubbles...
[19:14] peebrain: that doesn't really make sense though
[19:14] peebrain: you take your understanding of TK, and imprint it with the programming, to create a force bubble
[19:15] peebrain: so
[19:15] peebrain: now we have some more stuff to work with
[19:15] peebrain: if you can do constructs, and you can do some other psychic skills, you can combine them to do some cool things
[19:16] peebrain: the most common construct is a shield
[19:16] peebrain: I could take all day explaining different kinds of shields
[19:16] peebrain: so we'll just skip that topic, plus it's already covered in annie's seminar on psipog.net
[19:17] peebrain: so now the question becomes: what cool ideas can we come up with?
[19:17] peebrain: I'll talk about some things that I've done with constructs, and perhaps that can get you thinking

[19:18] peebrain: a few months back, I worked at a car dealership selling cars
[19:18] peebrain: the problem was that it was really really hot outside, and customers would walk up on the lot, and whoever got to the customer first was the person who sold the car
[19:18] peebrain: so I didn't want to stand outside to wait around for customers
[19:18] peebrain: but I didn't want to wait inside and miss out on customers
[19:19] peebrain: so I programmed a construct to continously scan the entire lot
[19:19] peebrain: it was the size of about a softball, and it would go around and look for people
[19:19] peebrain: if it found someone (who I didn't tell it to ignore), then it would report back to me
[19:19] peebrain: I programmed it to alert me by making my right wrist warm
[19:20] peebrain: I let the contruct loose, it starting wizzing around (you couldn't see it, but I could feel it's location if I focused on it)
[19:20] peebrain: that whole day I just sat in my nice cool office and waiting for my right wrist to turn warm
[19:20] peebrain: when it did, I followed the construct outside, and bingo, a customer
[19:20] peebrain: it worked pretty well :-)
[19:21] peebrain: (I no longer work there though, so I don't do it anymore)
[19:21] peebrain: that's just an example of using a construct in a normal every-day situation

[19:21] peebrain: if you're good with telepathy, constructs are definitely useful
[19:22] peebrain: constructs can be attatched to signal lines, and programmed to do certain things
[19:22] peebrain: usually when I send a construct to someone over the internet, I make a telepathic connection with them, create the construct, then program the construct to "follow the signal line"
[19:23] peebrain: a more advanced use that I've done is
[19:23] peebrain: create a construct that sits in a remote location
[19:23] peebrain: I send my signal line through the constrcut, and to my target
[19:23] peebrain: I program the contruct to self destruct, and destroy the link, if the target tries to backtrack the signal
[19:24] peebrain: so, if the target feels my link, and thinks "hmmm what is that? let me go see..."
[19:24] peebrain: they will trace the signal back to my construct, and my construct will destroy the signal line
[19:24] peebrain: and the target can't trace it back to me

[19:24] peebrain: another useful one I've done is just have a construct monitor someones emotions
[19:25] peebrain: I had an unstable friend for a while, and I was worried about him
[19:25] peebrain: so I had a construct follow him around, and any time my friend felt a certain emotion, the construct would alert me
[19:25] peebrain: and I could send my friend a mental hug :-P
[19:25] peebrain: the programming for that was mainly imprinting an emotion (using empathy) on the construct
[19:26] peebrain: telling the construct "follow this person around, and if they feel <this> emotion, alert me"

[19:26] peebrain: and for my last example, before the questions, just a few weeks ago I got a cat
[19:26] peebrain: I had read that cats are sensative to psi, so... I decided to test out the theory
[19:26] peebrain: I programmed the construct to "get a reaction"
[19:27] peebrain: I wanted to get a reaction to see if the cat was sensative
[19:27] peebrain: in that instance, the construct did indeed get a reaction... as I told it to
[19:27] peebrain: just not exactly what I expected :-P
[19:27] peebrain: the cat ran around from one end of the house, to the other
[19:27] peebrain: hiding under beds, running out from the bed, running to a room
[19:27] peebrain: running in circles, running away
[19:27] peebrain: at first I was like "wtf?"
[19:28] peebrain: then I remembered the construct, and disabled it :-P
[19:28] peebrain: I kind of made the construct in a "huh I'm bored" sense, and forgot I made it once something else distracted me :-P

[19:28] peebrain: so, those are a few examples of times I've used constructs to do things slightly more advanced than "sit there in the shape of a ball"
[19:29] peebrain: they're useful, they're fun, I say: constructs are good :-)
[19:29] peebrain: so, if you have any questions, NOW is the time to ask them
[19:29] peebrain: by PM'ing annie, not me
[19:29] peebrain: and she'll copy/paste the questions here
[19:29] annie: [17:29] <mazey> when you program a construction, do you tell it in words "seek for people around the yard", or something else, and if yes, do you repeat saying the same thing over and over or just once?
[19:30] peebrain: you can use words, if that's what works for you
[19:30] peebrain: like I said, most common way is visualization, after that you start to develop a feel for it
[19:30] peebrain: after you get a feel for it, you can use words, yes
[19:31] annie: [17:29] <SephirothsSon> How far can a construct be programmed to go?
[19:31] peebrain: I've sent constructs to people over the internet, I don't know how far the furthest one has gone, but I'm sure you can get them to go across the world
[19:31] peebrain: beyond that, it's hard to verify if you did it correctly
[19:31] annie: [17:29] <The_Ancient> can you inflict an emotion on someone only if he is accepting a connection from you? of like you said with the hug that all can accept them?
[19:32] peebrain: you can inflict emotions on people, that would fall under "empathetic projection"
[19:32] peebrain: and if you can project emotions, then you can program constructs to project emotions
[19:32] annie: [17:29] <A-I-M-> Annie ask him if his heard of a servitar and if its a sort of construst its a servant you create with your own energy and your personality and it serves you, I have one.
[19:32] peebrain: yes, I've heard of a "servitar", I'm not sure if it's the same as a construct, I think "servitar" is linked with wicca, but I'm not sure
[19:33] peebrain: it sounds pretty similar though
[19:33] annie: [17:30] <PyroSphere> are you saying that any mental capability you have you can program your construct to do the same? in theory then, couldnt you program a construct to pick up a pencil and write something if you were skilled with tk?
[19:33] peebrain: if you had the skill to do it with TK yourself, then yes, you can program a construct to do that
[19:33] annie: [17:30] <Super_wombat> why is tk needed to make a force bubble?
[19:33] peebrain: by definition of a force bubble - a construct with TK in it :-P
[19:33] annie: [17:30] <Swift'TP> well, if I wanted to keep a construct over a bridge near my house to warn me when my mother is close, I wanted to keep it there for a while, wouldnt it run out of energy quick?
[19:34] peebrain: it can run out of energy, you have to program it to either be very solid and not lose a lot of energy, or get energy from another source... or you can check on it every once in a while, and help it along if you think it's running low
[19:34] annie: [17:31] <InjectedSmile78> I made a psiball and imprinted "call me" on it and sent/threw it at my friend. She then called me. Was this using telepathy in constructs?
[19:34] peebrain: it seems so :-) good job
[19:35] annie: [17:31] <Wen> In what way did you program the emotion-monitoring construct to alert you?
[19:35] peebrain: it alerted me similar to a ping
[19:35] annie: [17:31] <The_Ancient> to send construct over to someone you cant see, so long distance, you have to know some telepathy?
[19:36] peebrain: telepathy would be your best bet - there may be another way to send it, perhaps if you take the time to program it to search out a specific address location... but that seems like overkill - learning to link with telepathy isn't that hard
[19:36] annie: [17:31] <SephirothsSon> I mean could you send one into space?
[19:36] peebrain: sure, you can send a construct into space, but how do you know if you were successful?
[19:36] peebrain: do you know any psions in space to verify?
[19:36] annie: [17:32] <JediKaren> is it possible to have a perament program to warn you if someone or something is close to you, that you can't see?
[19:36] peebrain: sure, that would be a good program for a shield
[19:37] peebrain: the hardest thing would be getting it to ignore objects that you don't want to be alerted of
[19:36] annie: [17:31] <_Triocalas|X> do you raise or store energy before manipulating?
[19:37] peebrain: no, I neither raise nor store energy before manipulating... I just move the psi where I want it
[19:37] peebrain: sleep and food restores psi for me naturally
[19:37] annie: [17:32] <cupido> you said that with telepathy you can make usefull constructs would this include cloaking shield
[19:37] peebrain: yes, indeed :-)
[19:37] annie: [17:32] <loconero> is it possible to spin a psi wheel with a construct? because a lot of people state against that. And if so do i need to pass the same thing I do normally when spinning it, with the construct?
[19:38] peebrain: if you can spin a pinwheel with TK, and you're good at programming constructs, then yes, you can program a construct to spin a pinwheel
[19:38] annie: [17:35] <A-I-M-> Ask him if Constructs are how some people create Daemons I know man can create them."I do"But is it similare in anyway and are daemons possibly rougue constructs
[19:39] peebrain: I don't understand all that earlier stuff, but I suppose rougue constructs would be possible
[19:39] peebrain: that's why it's usually suggested to program a kill command in your construct, like "do this and this, then self destruct in 2 days"
[19:39] annie: [17:33] <Raiyaka> Can I program a contstruct that makes me go OBE?
[19:39] peebrain: you cannot program a construct to do something that you can't do
[19:40] annie: [17:34] <Psi_Pyrodap> umm i was wondering if it was possible to program a construct to either drain or send the actual psi - as in i could have a link to somebody and we could lend each other psi
[19:40] annie: [17:38] <Psi_Pyrodap> please ask if it's possible to program a construct to either drain or send the actual psi - as in i could have a link to somebody and we could lend each other psi
[19:40] peebrain: constructs can drain and send psi that it has, or be programmed to get psi from another source, and redirect it
[19:40] annie: [17:36] <PyroSphere> You have mentioned before that visualization is not required in forming a psi ball; that it is merely a tool to get the desired effect. The only thing I have heard besides visualization in psi ball construction is focus. Does that mean that you only
[19:40] annie: [17:36] <PyroSphere> need to focus on the goal (a psi ball) to form one?
[19:41] peebrain: the translation is kind of... conscious mind -> visualization -> subconcsious mind -> psi ball.... what I do is basically conscious mind -> subconscious mind -> psi ball
[19:41] annie: [17:38] <The_Ancient> lets say you know TK and can make a psiwheel rotate. can you program your construct to rotate it when you clap your hands for example?
[19:42] peebrain: yes
[19:42] peebrain: although clapping might produce wind so you'd have to be careful :-P
[19:42] annie: [17:38] <cupido> if you drop a psi ball on a pin wheel could the pin whell go trough the needle if the psi ball is strong?
[19:42] peebrain: if the construct is a force bubble, it's possible
[19:42] annie: [17:39] <A-I-M-> Ask him if we can use other peoples construscts that they have left lying around like tools
[19:43] peebrain: you can use other peoples constructs if the construct allows it... or if you're just really good :-P
[19:43] peebrain: depends on the construct, depends on your skill, depends on the creators skill
[19:43] annie: [17:40] <InjectedSmile78> Could you program a construct to charge a phone?
[19:43] peebrain: charge a phone?
[19:43] peebrain: with what?
[19:44] peebrain: if you can use psychometery, then I suppose that makes sense
[19:46] annie: [17:44] <InjectedSmile78> a construct, like if you need to charge a phone could program a construct to charge it
[19:47] peebrain: I don't understand the verb "to charge"... if you mean psychometery, then: if you can do psychometery, then you can program a construct to do it
[19:47] annie: a battery i think he means.
[19:47] peebrain: oh a battery... if you can charge batteries with your mind, then you can program a construct to do it
[19:44] annie: [17:40] <mazey> if you program a construct to write a letter, would you be tired(as you would if you used TK write it) or wouldn't you?
[19:44] peebrain: you would be tired when you made the construct
[19:44] peebrain: when the construct performed the action, you wouldn't be tired
[19:45] annie: [17:42] <loconero> if i can spin the pin wheel without a glass, but not with. Would a construct help me with spinning it under the glass?
[19:45] peebrain: perhaps? that's a good idea, I might try that
[19:45] annie: [17:43] <Psi_Pyrodap> would it be possible to program a construct to increase abilities you already have? for example if I can spin a psiwheel, can the construct amplify my tk so i can roll a pencil?
[19:45] peebrain: I have heard of constructs amplifying telepathy signals, though I've never heard of them amplifying telekinesis, it would be a cool thing to try
[19:47] annie: [17:44] <cupido> is it possible to make replicas of yourself as constructs and affect pyshical matter?
[19:48] peebrain: heh, perhaps in theory, but that would take a shit load of psi, and a shit load of skill, which I don't think anyone has
[19:48] annie: [17:46] <A-I-M-> could you use your construct to actualy help you develope more skills or get skills from others?
[19:48] peebrain: you can learn skills through others, but that's kind of complicated... in general, a construct is more of a reflection of your own skills
[19:48] annie: [17:46] <Swift'TP> would it be easy to send a constuct into like a fireplace and make the fire shape into an evil face lol?
[19:49] peebrain: lol, like I've been saying: if you can shape fire with your mind, then you can program a construct to shape fire
[19:49] peebrain: ok
[19:49] peebrain: that's good for tonight, 50 minutes :-)
[19:49] peebrain: I hope you all enjoyed it, and it inspired some cool ideas
[19:50] peebrain: other than that, thanks for coming, and this log will be posted online who knows when
[19:50] peebrain: but it will eventually :-)
